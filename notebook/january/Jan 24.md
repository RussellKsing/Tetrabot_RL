## Modulation of orthogonal body waves enables high maneuverability in sidewinding locomotion

### Introduction

- multiplane undulation in sidewinders
- differential turning: slow, gradual turning across a number of cycles
- reversal turning: sudden and larger changes in direction without body rotation
- revealed third turning mode - frequency turning
- 2 wave system functions as a template and this enables complex behavior in high DOF systems

### Difference between snakes and fluid locomotion:
1. Substrate - body interactions not well understood
2. Different parts of body to contact the substrate and thereby control friction, drag and reaction forces

### Previous Model
- single frictional force model to explain lateral undulation

### Proposed model
- dynamic balancing

- Mechanism of sidewinding gait - see para 3
- Proposed: modulation of 2 waves was infact a "control template" - smallest number of variables and parameters that exhibits a behavior of interest
- seemingly complex turning behavior can be explained as modulations of the template

> how to modify the templates?
> how the template modulations was achieved?

- description and mechanism of both the turnings

### Testing turning templates in a Physical Robotic Model

- differential turning template description: when the amplitude of the horizontal wave changes along the body, such that the wave either increases or decreases amplitude as it propagates posteriorly 
- reversal turning template description: implemented via a sudden 180$\deg$ phase shift in the vertical wave

- used the same template for hard surface and showed similar behavior
- using the hypothesized templates, they showed that mechanical snakes perform same motion as those of the actual ones. Hence, the actual ones must be using the same mechanism
- further study to understand granular locomotion
- limited variables $\neq$ simple behaviors

- frequency turning achieved by making the 2 waves modulated with respect to each other
