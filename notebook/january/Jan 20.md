## Meeting with Baxi

- get snake biological data
- generate the shape basis function from this parametrization

- start with the similar experiment as that of the snake and repeat the same for tetrapods

- ML to modify the shape basis function to allow to do the interaction with the environment - 
online learning on these robots

- check slides - basically modify the shape basis function with RL so that the robot can turn
- to see what they can do with a broken leg

- underlying shape basis functions 
	- assumption is that it's the best way for evolution 

- start with homogeneous environment - no obstacle - robot to turn
- next stage - incorporate heterogeneity in the surface


- feedback control, collision with environment, self collision
- ML to avoid such configuration while having the required the locomotion
