- how to improve it.

### First Draft

Recent years has seen a large proportion of robotic locomotion research being inspired from biology, due to their inherent advantage in rough and dangerous environment, like sidewinders sliding on loose shifty sand. Such studies not only help us develop sophisticated locomotors for robots but could possibly help us gain insight of biological locomotion.

Locomotion can be achieved in limbic robots by finding a suitable gait, which are repeating sequence of motion of the limbs. Previously, researchers have used geometric mechanics to find a gait that can achieve the longest forward displacement for a robot. It involves finding a shape basis function that reduces the global behavior to low dimensional parameterized expression. However, they currently can't utilize the environment intelligently, nor do they take complexities such as intermittent contacts into consideration.

My particular focus will be on making a tetrabot (emulating a salamander) learn, how to walk on a heterogeneous surface. The first part of this project would involve deriving the shape basis functions for tetrabots walking on granular surface, using empirical study of biological systems. We would then apply reinforcement learning to modify these templates in order to perform locomotion on heterogeneous surface that may be uneven and not obstacle free. The robot should intelligently avoid configurations which may lead to self collision or collision with the environment. Moreover, it should learn to cleverly use these anomalies to its advantage and propel itself further. On the biology side of it, this can help us in understanding how walking salamanders modulate their templates in heterogeneous environment. This study could also be thought of as an opportunity to analyze and visualize machine learning outcomes and extract the meaning behind the decisions made by ML algorithms.

### Second Draft

Locomotion in limbic robots can be achieved by finding a suitable gait, which are repeating sequence of motion of the limbs. Previously, researchers have used geometric mechanics to find a gait that can achieve the longest forward displacement for snake robots. It involves finding a shape basis function that reduces the global behavior to low dimensional parameterized expression. Extending this work to limbic system presents its own set of challenges, like intermittent contact patters. Moreover, fixed shape basis function restricts its behavior and can't utilize the environment intelligently.

In past, biology has inspired sophisticated robotic locomotors, but this study, on the other hand, can help us understand how walking salamanders modulate their templates in heterogeneous environment. This study could also be thought of as an opportunity to analyze and visualize ML outcomes and extract the meaning behind the decisions made by ML algorithms.

### Final Draft

Researchers have previously used geometric mechanics to find a gait to achieve various motions for snake robots. It involves finding a shape basis function that reduces the global behavior to low dimensional parameterized expression. Extending this work to legged system presents its own set of challenges, like hybrid contact patterns. Moreover, fixed shape basis function can restrict its behavior such that the utilization and interaction of environment are not intelligent.
