## Today's work

- Same as yesterday, I tried to understand and play around with the code
- I changed the equation of motion of the robot by adding a new sin term to it, which required to add two new parameters
- Turns out, this was not what we were supposed to do
- We should add a new link to the robot's body which means, adding a new body angle and all the 6 parameters associated with it
- Spoke to Yedda about what she should read and work on, in the next few days
