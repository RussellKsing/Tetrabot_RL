## Discussion with Baxi about future prospects

Here are a few things we discussed that we should work on, in the coming week

1. Work on the python simulator and try to extend it to the Baximander

2. Make the robot's motion more smooth

3. Tracking system

I understood the work done so far which I summarize as follows:

- From videos of the salamander, we extract data
- We create a low dimensional representation of the data using geometric mechanics
- We call these representation, the templates which we use to set the initial parameters of the ML algorithm
- So we have the gait which allows the robot to move forward but we'd like to develop one to make it turn in place
- In future we'd like to look at how the robot can move omnidirectionally
- We need to come up with the list of features that we'd like to know about the surface
	- so that we can use ML to generate gaits so that the robot can move on any surface
