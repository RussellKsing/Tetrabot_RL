## Understand physics behind the robot

- Studied the equation of motion of the 3 linked 4 legged robot
- Understood the various parameters - known and unknown - and what they mean physically
- Studied the slides from previous work of Baxi and Jessie
	- specifically how they apply policy gradient RL to maximize the displacement of the robot
